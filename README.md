Assignment Description: "This program is going to simulate some of the common functionality of a pizza ordering site. The program will allow customers and employees to interact with the site and will begin by prompting the user to identify themselves (customer or employee).
If the user is an employee, they need to successfully log in to be able to change aspects of the site. Upon successful log in, employees should be provided the option to change the restaurant hours, add or remove items from the menu, or view or remove orders.
If the user is a customer, they should be provided with the option to search the menu by price or by ingredients (case insensitive) or place an order. When placing an order, a customer may select off the entire menu or from the last search result they examined.
Both kinds of users should have the option to view the menu, the restaurant hours, address or phone number. Users may also log out at anytime which will return them to the welcome prompt. From the welcome prompt they can end the program or log in as another user." (from assignment)
